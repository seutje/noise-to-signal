# Phase 3 — Verification Checklist

- [ ] Open `site/index.html` locally and confirm visuals respond to audio playback (file loader or album playlist).
- [ ] Toggle between Canvas and Three.js renderers; ensure both decode frames and respect quality settings.
- [ ] Validate UI controls: play/pause, prev/next (when playlist available), seek, sensitivity, smoothing, quality selector.
- [ ] Start/stop recording (`● Record` → `■ Stop`) and confirm saved WebM playback.

> Human supervisor: complete the checks above once browser validation passes. Update `PLAN.md` Phase 3 checklist accordingly.
