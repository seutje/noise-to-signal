# Phase 2 — Verification

- [ ] Sample grids captured (`training/outputs/val_samples.png`) and reviewed for quality.
- [ ] Generator checkpoint (`training/outputs/checkpoints/gan-best.ckpt`) exports without runtime loading errors.
- [ ] Optional ONNX export (`models/generator.fp32.onnx`) validated in PyTorch/onnxruntime.
- [ ] Training logs checked for stable convergence and absence of mode collapse.
- [ ] `models/meta.json` updated with checkpoint + latent metadata.
- [ ] DEVLOG entry reviewed and acknowledged.
